- **Generated**: 2025-08-22T10:52:46.925Z
- **Method**: Template-based generation with route-based structure

## Component Architecture

Each page header gets a unique component file to ensure page-specific content:
- Home page: `PageHeaderHome.tsx`
- About page: `PageHeaderAbout.tsx`
- Services page: `PageHeaderServices.tsx`

This prevents content duplication and ensures each page has relevant messaging.

## Route-Based Structure

Pages are generated based on routes, not names:
- Route `/` → `src/app/page.tsx` (home page)
- Route `/about` → `src/app/about/page.tsx`
- Route `/contact` → `src/app/contact/page.tsx`

## Import System

All imports use:
- **Default imports**: `import Component from './Component'` (no curly braces)
- **PascalCase paths**: `'@/components/Component'` (matches file names)

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Run development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Customization

All components are in `src/components/` and can be edited directly.
Each component file is unique to prevent cross-page content conflicts.
